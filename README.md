# odin-recipess

This is the first of many projects I will work through during the odin project's curriculum.

-Description: A recipe website.
	There will be traditional dishes from different parts of the world, like Japanese mochi, Peruvian causa and Chilean completo italiano.

-Skills that I will be using: 
HTML:
	-Boilerplate
	-Text tags
	-Anchor tags
	-Lists
	-Images
	-Relative and absolute paths
Git:
	-Basic Git workflow (Add working directory to staging area, commit to local repository, push to remote repository)
	-Making good commits, with good commit messages
	
-Goal: Putting all of the  knowledge acquired up to this point of the curriculum to practice by building a simple website (and also showcasing some delicious traditional food).
