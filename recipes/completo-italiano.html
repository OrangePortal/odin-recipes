<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Hot dogs are... not really a thing in Chile. If you gave any Chilean a bun with a sausage, a sauce or two and nothing else, they'd be confused, and a little bit dissapointed.</p>

<p>Not to throw any hate towards regular hot dogs, they taste great, but we Chileans are deeply in love with our Italianos.</p>
<p>Completo means complete or full. Italiano means Italian. You probably get the 'full' part, but, why <em>Italian</em>? Isn't this a <em>Chilean</em> recipe?</p>
<p>Well, let's take a look at the ingredients. First we have the usual bread and sausage, and then we have tomatoes, avocado and mayonnaise. <strong>Red</strong>, <strong>green</strong>, and <strong>white</strong>, the colors of the <em><strong>Italian flag!</strong></em></p>
<p>So, let's see how we make them.</p>
